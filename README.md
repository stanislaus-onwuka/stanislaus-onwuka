### Hi there 👋
I am Stanley Onwuka, a software engineer on weekdays and a Dj on weekends. I create ✨ _magic_ ✨ majorly with Javascript frameworks and CSS. I also play around with Figma sometimes.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🧑‍🎓: B.sc Computer Science
- 🔧 Building [The NOTI Company](https://thenoticompany.com/) and a few other cool things in my free time
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cool stuff about product engineering
