### Hi there 👋
I am Stanley Onwuka, a software engineer (frontend) on weekdays and a Dj on weekends. I create ✨ _magic_ ✨ majorly with Javascript frameworks and CSS. I also play around with Figma sometimes.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🧑‍🎓: B.sc Computer Science
- 🔭 I’m currently working for starts ups like [The NOTI Company](https://thenoticompany.com)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some more cool stuff about UI engineering
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who has something fun to work on
