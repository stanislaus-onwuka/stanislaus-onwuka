### Hi there 👋
I am Stanley Onwuka, a frontend web developer and an amateur UI/UX designer. I create ✨ _magic_ ✨ majorly with Javascript(React) and CSS. 

**stanislaus-onwuka/stanislaus-onwuka** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🧑‍🎓: I am a 300 Computer science student
- 🔭 I’m currently working with a startup (been here for more than a year now )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some more cool stuff (you'll find out soon 🌚)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who has something fun to work on
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email:](kachi2505@yahoo.com), [Twitter:](https://twitter.com/callme5t4n5)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a big fan of music and I run a music talk show. [Check it out 😉](https://opussessions.netlify.app/)
