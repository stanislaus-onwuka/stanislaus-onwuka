### Hi there 👋
I am Stanley Onwuka, a frontend web developer and an amateur UI/UX designer. I create ✨ _magic_ ✨ majorly with Javascript(React) and CSS. I am also a big fan of music.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🧑‍🎓: I am a Computer science student
- 🔭 I’m currently looking to work for starts ups
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some more cool stuff (you'll find out soon 🌚)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who has something fun to work on
